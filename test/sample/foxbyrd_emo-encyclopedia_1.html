<title>Emo Encyclopedia - Rate Your Music</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A personal journal of [Genre48] + associated genres. This list is going to be updated constantly, and will include my feelings and thoughts about individual releases, bands, labels, artwork, and et cetera. It will also include information about each band as well as contextual history or miscellaneous trivia. This list will primarily focus on discussing and compiling underrated or unfairly ignored works, typically staying outside the conventional canon of emo music. There will be exceptions, as canonized works that are crucial or key to comprehension of the genre will be included. Some [Genre49] releases that aren&#39;t necessarily [Genre27865] will also be included, as long as they have notable similarities with most emotive hardcore. Everything in this list will somehow fall under the broad category of [Genre49].

Genres discussed in this list:
[Genre27865], [Genre48], [Genre496], [Genre27516], [Genre49], [Genre333], [Genre56], [Genre41435], [Genre101]

This list used to have an artwork archive. However, at the previous location of my archive, my account was terminated for an unknown reason. I will update this list with a new and improved artwork archive when it&#39;s feasible for me to do so. For the meantime, if you wish to see anything, send me a PM and I should be able to send you some inserts and whatnot if I have them.

It was birthed from the Washington, D.C. hardcore punk scene during a period of time labeled the &#34;<a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution_Summer_(music)"> Revolution Summer</a>&#34;, which occured in 1985. Revolution Summer marked a leap forward within the punk community, with associated bands taking a stance against violence, sexism, and similar issues that plagued many hardcore scenes. The bands <a title="[Artist9566]"  href="/artist/rites_of_spring" class="artist"> Rites of Spring</a>, <a title="[Artist14432]"  href="/artist/embrace-1" class="artist"> Embrace</a>, <a title="[Artist21784]"  href="/artist/moss-icon" class="artist"> Moss Icon</a>, and <a title="[Artist9677]"  href="/artist/dag-nasty" class="artist"> Dag Nasty</a> are all considered the essential acts of this time, serving as progenitors to emo. Initially, these bands were labeled <a  class="genre" href="/genre/emocore/">Emocore</a>, which is now only used retroactively to classify the sonic differences between the burgeoning scene and modern emotional hardcore.<br /><br />           The term emo is relatively controversial, especially with regards to how mainstream media and culture portray emo, often muddying the waters with comparisons to scene culture. From the birth of the word, the term &#34;emo&#34; has been criticized, often for its implication that <a  class="genre" href="/genre/hardcore-punk/">Hardcore Punk</a> wasn&#39;t emotional to begin with. Fans of the genre only refer to it as emo due to the massive sonic differences that evolved over time, separating emo from other strains of hardcore. To put it simply, it would be inaccurate to call this music hardcore punk. Seeing as there is nothing else to call it, we call it <a  class="genre" href="/genre/emo/">Emo</a>. Over the decades as emotional hardcore progressed, it split off in to many different subgenres and styles. In the mid-nineties there was a massive influx of indie rock influenced bands playing emotional hardcore, creating the genre of <a  class="genre" href="/genre/midwest-emo/">Midwest Emo</a>. This style of music was characterized by whinier vocals, twinkly guitar parts, and a generally more melodramatic image.

Revolution Summer marked a leap forward within the punk community, with associated bands taking a stance against violence, sexism, and similar issues that plagued many hardcore scenes.

From the birth of the word, the term &#34;emo&#34; has been criticized, often for its implication that <a  class="genre" href="/genre/hardcore-punk/">Hardcore Punk</a> wasn&#39;t emotional to begin with. Fans of the genre only refer to it as emo due to the massive sonic differences that evolved over time, separating emo from other strains of hardcore. To put it simply, it would be inaccurate to call this music hardcore punk. Seeing as there is nothing else to call it, we call it <a  class="genre" href="/genre/emo/">Emo</a>. Over the decades as emotional hardcore progressed, it split off in to many different subgenres and styles. In the mid-nineties there was a massive influx of indie rock influenced bands playing emotional hardcore, creating the genre of <a  class="genre" href="/genre/midwest-emo/">Midwest Emo</a>. This style of music was characterized by whinier vocals, twinkly guitar parts, and a generally more melodramatic image.

They stand out as one of the most shadowy and unrelentingly miserable acts in the entire genre of emo, the spirit of their music having more in common with the atmospheric rawness of depressive black metal than hardcore. The production within their discography is notedly low fidelity and abrasive, amplifying the enormous sound that the band has. Dirge-like, funereal, and tinged with overwhelming sentimentality. These songs awaken from the tinny crackle of their old 7&#34; and slowly rise and rise in to an eruption of unfiltered heartache and furious keening. Massive crescendos pour in an out of the angular guitarwork, all constructing a platform for the dejected screams. Lyrically speaking, this release has some of the most disenchanted phrases one can attribute to emo music. They&#39;re an accurate reflection of the liminal space between childhood and adolescence, a witnessing of the corrupt evil that is the world around you. The sound of seeing the domestic horrors of complicated relationships and broken families. <br /><i><br />negative images regarding a permanent cardboard-covered stay below the hollow crust of a bridge<br />half-awake on a disintegrating couch, trash can fires silently fume feet away under solemn supervision<br />the sound of a crumbling sedan roaring above you as fast as possible towards a wall of thunderheads<br />moss trees, spore-patches, brutal silence, and a xeroxed life.</i><br /><br />The peak crescendo of &#34;Seven&#34; deserves to be marked as one of, if not the most, essential moment in 90&#39;s emo. It is a summation of every depressive murmur that one can muster, exposed in their hopeless and morose vehemence. The power of this 7&#34; can not be understated. It&#39;s relentless and primal, apocalyptic and final. Without a doubt a prime example of catharsis straight from a tattered heart.<br /><br /><a title="[Artist203286]"  href="/artist/breakwater-1" class="artist"> Breakwater</a> formed in Victoria, BC, Canada in 1994 and disbanded in 1996.

There is rumored to be a second unofficial demo cassette roaming around somewhere in somebody&#39;s forlorn and forgotten collection, however there is unfortunately no upload of said demo anywhere on the internet.

Perhaps it is somebody misremembering, or truly a lead in regards to finding the full discography of this band. Nobody knows, and fingers crossed something shall come of it soon.

They stand out as one of the most shadowy and unrelentingly miserable acts in the entire genre of emo, the spirit of their music having more in common with the atmospheric rawness of depressive black metal than hardcore. The production within their discography is notedly low fidelity and abrasive, amplifying the enormous sound that the band has. Dirge-like, funereal, and tinged with overwhelming sentimentality. These songs awaken from the tinny crackle of their old 7&#34; and slowly rise and rise in to an eruption of unfiltered heartache and furious keening. Massive crescendos pour in an out of the angular guitarwork, all constructing a platform for the dejected screams. Lyrically speaking, this release has some of the most disenchanted phrases one can attribute to emo music. They&#39;re an accurate reflection of the liminal space between childhood and adolescence, a witnessing of the corrupt evil that is the world around you. The sound of seeing the domestic horrors of complicated relationships and broken families. <br /><i><br />negative images regarding a permanent cardboard-covered stay below the hollow crust of a bridge<br />half-awake on a disintegrating couch, trash can fires silently fume feet away under solemn supervision<br />the sound of a crumbling sedan roaring above you as fast as possible towards a wall of thunderheads<br />moss trees, spore-patches, brutal silence, and a xeroxed life.</i><br /><br />The peak crescendo of &#34;Seven&#34; deserves to be marked as one of, if not the most, essential moment in 90&#39;s emo. It is a summation of every depressive murmur that one can muster, exposed in their hopeless and morose vehemence. The power of this 7&#34; can not be understated. It&#39;s relentless and primal, apocalyptic and final. Without a doubt a prime example of catharsis straight from a tattered heart.<br /><br /><a title="[Artist203286]"  href="/artist/breakwater-1" class="artist"> Breakwater</a> formed in Victoria, BC, Canada in 1994 and disbanded in 1996. Their discography existed only of a few scattered compilation appearances, a demo, a split, and this 7&#34;. There is rumored to be a second unofficial demo cassette roaming around somewhere in somebody&#39;s forlorn and forgotten collection, however there is unfortunately no upload of said demo anywhere on the internet. The only evidence suggesting this demo exists is a comment on the legendary Sophie&#39;s Floorboard blog. Perhaps it is somebody misremembering, or truly a lead in regards to finding the full discography of this band. Nobody knows, and fingers crossed something shall come of it soon. It would make sense that such tape exists, considering all their songs are labeled numerically, and there are gaps in the consistency of titles. This band was also notable for featuring the incredible musician Dave Wenger, who was also in the bands <a title="[Artist262855]"  href="/artist/daddys-hands" class="artist"> Daddy&#39;s Hands</a>, <a title="[Artist173890]"  href="/artist/m-blanket" class="artist"> M Blanket</a>, <a title="[Artist152987]"  href="/artist/moral-decay-1" class="artist"> Moral Decay</a>, and <a title="[Artist569853]"  href="/artist/ache-hour-credo" class="artist"> Ache Hour Credo</a>.

The new food market on the corner freaking you out because it lays on top of the land where you planted little tomato seeds with your mom as a toddler. Wishing you’ll one day get attention for all the cool drawings you put in your school notebook. Dog-greased car seat windowsills and matte images of autumnal colors flashing at high speeds. A reminder that as far as you’re concerned right now the suburbs were the only real place that ever existed anyways. This album is the culmination of necessary childhood catharsis.

This album is a lost classic, and one of the pinnacles of passionate screamo.</span></td></tr><!-- @@_list_item_12 --><tr class="trodd"><td class="list_art" ><a href="/release/ep/coleman/coleman/"><img  width="150" id="img_l_556709"  class="lazyload"   data-src="//e.snmc.io/i/150/w/dff1fc2434aad94358013873612e7af2/2091691"  alt="Coleman" title="Coleman" src="//e.snmc.io/2.5/img/images/blank.png" /></a></td><td class="main_entry" ><h2><a   href="/artist/coleman" class="list_artist">Coleman</a></h2>

Make sure to give this a listen if you&#39;re interested in the roots of emoviolence.</span></td></tr><!-- @@_list_item_18 --><tr class="trodd"><td class="list_art" ><a href="/release/ep/evergreen/these-last-days/"><img  width="150" id="img_l_158213"  class="lazyload"   data-src="//e.snmc.io/i/150/w/befe498330d3e6c706d616e2330587df/2042004"  alt="These Last Days" title="These Last Days" src="//e.snmc.io/2.5/img/images/blank.png" /></a></td><td class="main_entry" ><h2><a   href="/artist/evergreen_f1" class="list_artist">Evergreen</a></h2>

The opener, &#34;Freighttrains and Windsongs&#34;, is definitely my favorite on the release. The song is incredibly gorgeous, sweeping guitar lines outfitting crooning vocals and reserved drums. It feels very slowcore-adjacent. The second song, &#34;Gladhand&#34;, is a little more experimental. It feels improvised in away, bucolic textures colliding to form more of an atmosphere than a song. &#34;Prainer the VIII&#34;, the final song, continues in the same vein as the first.

It summates many of the trademarks that can be found in the recent years of the genre&#39;s history in a truly loveable way; raw, endearing, and more than anything else, cathartic. All four tracks here are filled to the brim with an intense passion and a charming DIY-oriented sound, allowing the band to capture an engaging style of powerful emotion and artistry. The opening song, &#34;Decay (Alone)&#34; is a heartfelt ode to the disintegration of relationships and the sadness that comes with such tragedy. Its sprinkled with quotes from the films <a  href="/film/naked/" class="film">Naked</a> and <a  href="/film/my_dinner_with_andre/" class="film">My Dinner with Andre</a>, both excerpts dealing with a sense of existential dread and sadness. The spoken accompaniments allow the song&#39;s message to really be driven home in a thought-provoking way that wouldn&#39;t have been achievable otherwise.<br /><br />My favorite track on the release is the melodic dirge &#34;Before I Self Destruct&#34;, which is by far the most cinematic song here. The catchy and overdriven primary guitar part really allows the song to shine and revel in its cathartic emotional exertion. The vocal delivery throughout all songs here is great as well, and is extremely genuine in its execution. I feel like all members of the band get to shine the most on the closer, &#34;We Can&#39;t Stop Here, This is Marlboro Country&#34;, which is another standout on the EP. The intro is the fastest and most aggressive section on the release, showing that the band doesn&#39;t lose their balance when the tempo speeds up. The song eventually moves forward in to a swirl of reverbed guitars bringing a relatively upbeat sense of closure to everything. The EP closes with an endearing sample of the band jamming out in their rehearsal space. It&#39;s a funny little bit that just makes this release feel all the more personal and heartfelt. If you&#39;re interested in the modern screamo underground and the wonderful music that&#39;s being produced in it, Floral Patterns could not be a better starting place to dive in.

It gives me the same fragile tension and sadness that Edward Hopper&#39;s paintings bring, a bucolic sadness drenched in a warm coat of nostalgia. It&#39;s definitely one of the best emo songs ever, and deserves to be heard by all fans of the genre. This EP is a magical little world in and of itself, and should be in regular rotation for indie emo enthusiasts.</span></td></tr><!-- @@_list_item_24 --><tr class="trodd"><td class="list_art" ><a href="/release/ep/the-gangplansisteele-quartet/the-gangplansisteele-quartet/"><img  height="150" id="img_l_12423400"  class="lazyload"   data-src="//e.snmc.io/i/150/w/284d6baa17e5c518ec69e7978e2d1e87/8860407"  alt="The Gangplansisteele Quartet" title="The Gangplansisteele Quartet" src="//e.snmc.io/2.5/img/images/blank.png" /></a></td><td class="main_entry" ><h2><a   href="/artist/the-gangplansisteele-quartet" class="list_artist">The Gangplansisteele Quartet</a></h2>

Every instrumental performance is just as passionate as the vocals, especially the metrical and expansive drumming, which is complimented by a very unique and room-y snare sound.

The sound of tortured fence posts, mossy trees and angular formations of cracked stone. Fogged up mirrors circled with icy runes. Vaguely-bloodied railroad tracks and rotting leaves staining an iridescent skyline. Sagging telephones poles &amp; tied shoelaces thrown up over the edge of a matte insulation. Artificial bone-white planks of chipped wood stacked in the suggested shape of a house. Tornado sirens lining periphery, covered in weather-marks and invisible waste-signs. Sleeping orchids and worn-out piano benches. Keys stuck to the floor of the ivory-door, locked up in a broken gold. Beds of flowers and chalk nails dispersed around a neighborhood. A soft blanket of pale shelter embraced by the roof below you. A nocturnal ambivalence encased by future-weary unease.<br /><br />The music feels apocalyptic, in a way. It&#39;s penultimate and is carried by a tone of miserable acceptance. It&#39;s unforgiving and brutal while remaining fragile. Many of the songs are outlined with anthemic clean vocals, supporting the keening screams. There is a soft twinkle in all of the tracks, propagating this delicate dichotomy between rage and sadness.

I connect deeply with the same emotional chaos that is presented here. Simultaneously life-affirming and absolutely devastating, one of if not the best screamo release ever recorded.<br /><br />Attached below is a write-up from the band themselves.

To say that we did those same things would be the very truth of what we accomplished in the three years since Jon and I said we wanted to be in a band that sounded like Neil Perry. In the time we did this we found our medication for whatever troubles the adolescent young adult mind can come up with, break ups, broken hearts, mind games,self doubt, looking to the future and being uncertain where you&#39;ll be. These things pushed us to find a way to cope with our lives in a hard time. We found solace in our friendships. To think of everything we&#39;ve been through and how honest we were lyrically and musically with this band can only be found by the people who chose to look there for it. We did this for everyone who ever cared about us, but couldn&#39;t do it without each other. To be over and done with now makes me feel good, I know I&#39;ll always have this time to look back on.

There is a sarcastic disenchantment guiding each song here -- the same feeling one would get from living in denial of some emotional catastrophe, recovering from the remains of a broken and misconstrued line of communication. It&#39;s the sound of heartbreak and supreme self-pity turning in to a lifetime of hating the world around you and anyone who you come in to contact with. The transition from caring deeply about those who are supporting you in your times of need to being angry at them for even suggesting assistance. The album plays back to the listener like a summary of trauma, a retelling of the past month&#39;s pain, however some place through it becomes a diatribe against yourself and a desperate attempt to try and not cry. It&#39;s the dichotomic struggle of grappling with juvenile emotions, yet being too helpless to even try to feel another way. <br /><br />You can audibly hear the catharsis in the music here, as each scream yelps and bursts its way through the roaring tide of distortion and rage. A desolate sadness is to be felt in the more slowcore influenced songs, such as &#34;Kind of a Long Way Down,&#34; where through reserved prose a suicide is recounted from the perspective of a confused onlooker. Each song on the record tells some ingenious tale of nuanced despair, reflecting the inner turmoil of those writing it in some poetic façade. The humorous tragedy of confusing a drowning swimmer with a happy waving smile, the sardonic description of an &#39;urban barbie&#39; hiding undertones of furious jealousy. Although not included on original pressings of the record, &#34;To a Husband at War&#34; serves as a perfect thesis for the atmosphere this band is trying to evoke. In it contains some of the most utterly depressing lyrics I&#39;d argue were ever put to tape. It&#39;s a tale of distance and touch-starvation, an inability to comfort your lover as they meet an uncertain death.<br /><br /> A wife to a husband at war hasn&#39;t seen them for months as their lover spends time in a brutal war, each day fearing for his existence. Unable to communicate, unable to connect, and unable to move forward. Each day is spent in reflection of how things used to be, drowning in a dreadful anxiety. Upon the news of his death, the wife mistakenly recounts running to her room and crying, only correcting herself later as the room belonged to the both of them. He&#39;s been gone so long that her mind instinctually considered it no longer his abode. As soon as such realization occurs, the song erupts in to a blistering anguish -- tidal waves of raw emotion and rage swallow you whole as a call for retreat sounds in the distance. In these lyrics, a subdued message can be found. It perfectly summates the body&#39;s unstoppable urge to move on in direct opposition to the mind&#39;s inability to let go. Not only are you in a conflict with your missing lover, you exist in a state of conflict with your mental and physical needs. It&#39;s miserable, and it&#39;s terrifying to analyze for long periods of time. Unfortunately for most, there is nothing that anybody can do about this liminal feeling of existential unease. The only hope for a future is to find higher meaning in your pain, and turn it in to such beautiful art as this.</span></span><td></td></tr><tr class="show-for-small-table-row treven"><td colspan=4 class="list_mobile_description"><span class="rendered_text">In my mind, this record evokes feelings of intoxicating misery.

The vocals totally blow out in to a harsh noise wall at the seven minute thirty seconds mark, allowing the band to bring the heaving violence to a worthy conclusion. The track collapses in to a funeral dirge-like exhaustion, melting away in to a pool of aquatic ambiance by its end.

Every second of this album is packed with poetic brutality, both lyrically and music-wise. The sheer relentless emotion makes it disturbing in aura -- it feels so apocalyptic, shrouded in oblique angularity.  The melodic riffs in &#34;The Monologue of the Century&#34;, the steady blast at the beginning of &#34;Exit 29 Collapsed as I Drove By&#34;, and of course, the iconic chorus of &#34;It&#39;s More Like a Message to You&#34; - all monolithic and devastating moments that define the strength of this genre and its music. <br /><br />This albums taunts and dances around with a withered and raw emanation, seemingly dangling its obscure meaning right in front of the listener as they immerse themselves in it.

Repeated listens reward great benefits, and the impenetrably anxious wall of noise begins to make sense after you can identify with the emotions it presents. <br /><br />The haywire sonics here are the product of internal chaos and anger, such seething emotiveness that wouldn&#39;t be able to be expressed any other way. Every second of this album is packed with poetic brutality, both lyrically and music-wise. The sheer relentless emotion makes it disturbing in aura -- it feels so apocalyptic, shrouded in oblique angularity.  The melodic riffs in &#34;The Monologue of the Century&#34;, the steady blast at the beginning of &#34;Exit 29 Collapsed as I Drove By&#34;, and of course, the iconic chorus of &#34;It&#39;s More Like a Message to You&#34; - all monolithic and devastating moments that define the strength of this genre and its music. <br /><br />This albums taunts and dances around with a withered and raw emanation, seemingly dangling its obscure meaning right in front of the listener as they immerse themselves in it. For the sake of postponing further pretension, its hard writing about this album. No words will ever really able to do it justice. Untouchable and jaw-droppingly unique, <a  href="/release/album/jeromes-dream/seeing-means-more-than-safety/" class="album"> Seeing Means More Than Safety</a> is a masterwork through and through.</span></td></tr><!-- @@_list_item_38 --><tr class="trodd"><td class="list_art" ><a href="/release/album/jeromes-dream/presents/"><img  width="150" id="img_l_48987"  class="lazyload"   data-src="//e.snmc.io/i/150/w/6cf0ed464fa6d328b024cde352bb2a2d/7525834"  alt="Presents" title="Presents" src="//e.snmc.io/2.5/img/images/blank.png" /></a></td><td class="main_entry" ><h2><a   href="/artist/jeromes-dream" class="list_artist">Jeromes Dream</a></h2>

The group was from Ohio, and played alongside other groups such as <a title="[Artist299450]"  href="/artist/grain-7" class="artist"> Grain</a>, <a title="[Artist287793]"  href="/artist/the_man_i_fell_in_love_with" class="artist"> The Man I Fell In Love With</a>, and <a title="[Artist15533]"  href="/artist/harriet-the-spy" class="artist"> Harriet the Spy</a>. One of the most interesting things about this band would be their connection to the seminal EarthQuaker Devices pedal company. Jeff France (aka Fej), who is now a production manager for the company, played guitar and sang in this band. Many of these seminal Ohio emo bands have connections to EarthQuaker, with Jamie Stillman (of <a title="[Artist15533]"  href="/artist/harriet-the-spy" class="artist"> Harriet the Spy</a> and <a  href="/label/donut_friends_records/" class="label">Donut Friends Records</a>) founding the company. It&#39;s pretty cool to see that such an awesome company has roots in some high quality and enjoyable hardcore bands. Check this group out if you&#39;re interested in late-90&#39;s emo, they&#39;re definitely worth your time.</span></td></tr><!-- @@_list_item_43 --><tr class="treven"><td class="list_art" ><a href="/release/ep/little-whales/an-exercise-in-patience/"><img  width="150" id="img_l_12564267"  class="lazyload"   data-src="//e.snmc.io/i/150/w/89166d66b1c3a7170f4f708d169d1e19/8732458"  alt="An Exercise in Patience" title="An Exercise in Patience" src="//e.snmc.io/2.5/img/images/blank.png" /></a></td><td class="main_entry" ><h2><a   href="/artist/little-whales" class="list_artist">Little Whales</a></h2>

It is stated on the back cover however that this EP was recorded by Marco Acosta at Buffalo Laboratories between May 18th and 19th, 1996; yet once more it doesn&#39;t specify if Acosta was in the group or if he had produced the record. Regardless of its relative obscurity and mystery, the music contained on this seven-inch is thoroughly enjoyable mid-90&#39;s emo. <br /><br />The two songs here are cryptic and atmospheric in nature, twirling and repetitive guitar lines dancing around minimalist bass and drum arrangements. The sparsity of the instrumentation and low-fidelity recording give this seven-inch a remarkably intimate feeling, almost as if you&#39;re right up next to the group as their playing these wistful dirges. The first song, &#34;Bigger Miracles&#34;, is a sprawling and pastoral track. The opening bass riff never fails to set me in a contemplative mood. Dynamics are key here, as tension unravels and builds all across the song. The vocal delivery is very endearing too, reciting floating and wispy poems on top of the reflective music.

Images of dejected drives through city-outskirts and passing by suburban decay flood my mind as I listen, the swung rhythms and strumming guitar evoking a deep melancholy. I adore the vocal delivery in this track even more-so than the first, with the singing taking a much more whisper-oriented approach. It&#39;s easily one of my favorite songs from this period of emo, as is this seven-inch as a whole for the genre.

I deeply encourage all those reading this to share his stories and respect his memory. Celebrate his life and art, recognize the wonderful gifts that he gave us. It truly hurts how so many incredible people can be taken from us in such a short period of time.

The band released one split, one seven-inch, and one full-length, all of which being distributed by legendary <a  href="/label/donut_friends_records/" class="label">Donut Friends Records</a>. Two members of the group, Joe Dennis and Jon Finley, also played in <a   href="/artist/the_party_of_helicopters" class="artist">The Party of Helicopters</a>, another emo-adjacent Kent-based outfit with a more noisier take on hardcore. All across the discography of this group lay intoxicatingly dreamy and ethereal melodies, wrapped in wistful and low-fidelity D.I.Y. presentations that give their work a certain homely comfort. This seven-inch in particular resonates deeply with me, epitomizing those aforementioned musical elements all the while carving a uniquely twee niche in the genre. <br /><br />The three songs here are imbued with (for lack of a better word) &#34;magical&#34; stylings, as shown through the cryptic lyrical content and idiosyncratic guitar arrangements. At the core of all of these tracks there is a heart of hook-y pop influence, really giving them a notable staying power -- I often get the verses for &#34;Pompeii This Morning&#34; and &#34;The Dignity Workshop (For Two)&#34; stuck in my head. The songwriting and arrangement on this seven-inch are nothing short of impressive as well. Every instrument on here plays with purpose, building and compliment each other wonderfully. The sparse and minimal drums serve as a unique trait of the band as well, reveling in very post-rock-esque crescendo flourishes.

The band released one split, one seven-inch, and one full-length, all of which being distributed by legendary <a  href="/label/donut_friends_records/" class="label">Donut Friends Records</a>. Two members of the group, Joe Dennis and Jon Finley, also played in <a   href="/artist/the_party_of_helicopters" class="artist">The Party of Helicopters</a>, another emo-adjacent Kent-based outfit with a more noisier take on hardcore. All across the discography of this group lay intoxicatingly dreamy and ethereal melodies, wrapped in wistful and low-fidelity D.I.Y. presentations that give their work a certain homely comfort. This seven-inch in particular resonates deeply with me, epitomizing those aforementioned musical elements all the while carving a uniquely twee niche in the genre. <br /><br />The three songs here are imbued with (for lack of a better word) &#34;magical&#34; stylings, as shown through the cryptic lyrical content and idiosyncratic guitar arrangements. At the core of all of these tracks there is a heart of hook-y pop influence, really giving them a notable staying power -- I often get the verses for &#34;Pompeii This Morning&#34; and &#34;The Dignity Workshop (For Two)&#34; stuck in my head. The songwriting and arrangement on this seven-inch are nothing short of impressive as well. Every instrument on here plays with purpose, building and compliment each other wonderfully. The sparse and minimal drums serve as a unique trait of the band as well, reveling in very post-rock-esque crescendo flourishes.

Fusing a Louisville hardcore sound, the intense technicality of math rock, and the depressive tendencies of second wave emocore, their music was a swirling and frightening amalgam of thrashing freak-outs and melodic anxiety. Minimal and threadbare in instrumentation, yet gargantuan in dynamics and presence. <a  href="/release/album/a-minor-forest/flemish-altruism-constituent-parts-1993-1996/" class="album"> Flemish Altruism</a> is considering their masterwork, a sprawling double LP produced by both <a title="[Artist252729]"  href="/artist/steve-albini" class="artist"> Steve Albini</a> and <a title="[Artist954111]"  href="/artist/bob_weston_f1" class="artist"> Bob Weston</a> of <a title="[Artist5187]"  href="/artist/shellac" class="artist"> Shellac</a>. The even-numbered tracks on the album were recorded by Albini, while the odd were recorded by Weston. The separation and recording differences between the two are of an important note - the even tracks are more noisy and in-line with the noise rock musings of <a title="[Artist10540]"  href="/artist/rodan" class="artist"> Rodan</a> or <a title="[Artist2730]"  href="/artist/don-caballero" class="artist"> Don Caballero</a>, while the odds are more atmospheric and depressive, evening the pace out with slowcore-inspired dirges. Although it is not explicitly stated, many listeners have pointed out that the track-listing may be the combination of two previously separate records. One (the odds) would be slower, and one (the evens) would be faster, thus the denotation &#34;<i>Constituent Parts</i>&#34; in the title. Within each song still remains an obvious link to one another however, and the perceived separates still works fantastically as a united whole. In line with the majority of math rock, some of these tracks have long and absurd titles. Unlike some infuriatingly <a  href="/release/ep/minus-the-bear/this-is-what-i-know-about-being-gigantic/" class="album"> tacky</a> examples within the genre, these names actually play to the advantage of the song. They contribute quite well to the unorthodox and unsettling atmosphere this record conjures. <br /><br />The first song &#34;But the Pants Stay On...&#34; is a harmonics-driven number. Complimented by barely-audible yet despairing vocals, the melancholic piece serves as a good summative of the record&#39;s dynamics. There are some math-y explosions interspersed amongst the slower segments, as per the quiet-loud-quiet dynamic pattern. The second track on the record, the ridiculously titled &#34;Bill&#39;s Mom Likes to Fuck&#34;, is a much longer and more intense number. It&#39;s incredibly sprawling, each movement composing the entire song being quite ephemeral. The first five minutes or so are composed of a swaying call-and-response, distorted descending lines angrily retorting to minimal clean passages. Afterwards, things pick up quite considerably, the song shifting in to a consistent mid-tempo middle section. Still instrumental, the dissonant guitar bounces atop the heavy bass with great contrast. Near the six minute mark, vocals come in, and things begin to crescendo. The song slowly builds and builds, each repetitive iteration gradually become louder and more driven than the last. The vocals rise, eventually breaking in to a cathartic yell as things distort even further. They quickly turn to incendiary screams as chaos descends upon the track. The math-y anxiety of the first movement has now been distorted in to a thrashing and cathartic breakdown that sounds straight off of <a  href="/release/comp/indian-summer/science-1994/" class="album"> Science 1994</a>. Hissing and impassioned screams erupt in violent fervor on top of some of the most brutal playing these genres have to offer. The song, no longer able to push the intensity any further, slowly disintegrates, each instrument falling apart and collapsing in exhaustion. Immediately, as the song ends, we are thrust in to &#34;Ed is 50&#34;. This pattern continues throughout the record - brutality immediately confronted by startling silence. The most drastic example of this is perhaps the beginning of the hilariously-titled &#34;Jacking Off George Lucas&#34;. In an incredible contrast to the title, the song is genuinely one of the most depressive and miserable songs I&#39;ve ever heard. It is without a doubt in my eyes the standout track on the record, and the one I&#39;ve returned to the most. Very much in the vein of <a title="[Artist819]"  href="/artist/slint" class="artist"> Slint</a>&#39;s Washer, it is a post-rock/slowcore dirge that trods upon the listener with arresting sadness. The vocals are again barely audible, yet the emotion in the half-spoken delivery is what allows them to have such an undeniable effect. Quiet, then loud, and then quiet again, the song contains some of the most impressive dynamics to be found in their whole discography. Half-way through the song, things quickly crescendo, and out of nowhere it becomes even more depressing and dismal. A heart-rending and melodic cello erupts in conjunction with the guitar line, and the vocals keen in distress and patient rage. Stunningly beautiful yet miserably bleak. Afterwards, yet again, contrast being key, the album throws the listener in to &#34;Speed For Gavin&#34;. For the sake of brevity, I am not going to describe in thorough detail the entire track listing. I don&#39;t want this write-up to be overly long, and I don&#39;t want to perhaps spoil any surprises one may have while listening to this record. <br /><br /><a  href="/release/album/a-minor-forest/flemish-altruism-constituent-parts-1993-1996/" class="album"> Flemish Altruism</a> is without a doubt one of the most incredible records that this vein of emotional hardcore has to offer.
