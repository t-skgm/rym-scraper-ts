From the birth of the word, the term "emo" has been criticized, often for its implication that <a class="genre" href="/genre/hardcore-punk/">Hardcore Punk</a> wasn't emotional to begin with. Fans of the genre only refer to it as emo due to the massive sonic differences that evolved over time, separating emo from other strains of hardcore. To put it simply, it would be inaccurate to call this music hardcore punk. Seeing as there is nothing else to call it, we call it <a class="genre" href="/genre/emo/">Emo</a>. Over the decades as emotional hardcore progressed, it split off in to many different subgenres and styles. In the mid-nineties there was a massive influx of indie rock influenced bands playing emotional hardcore, creating the genre of <a class="genre" href="/genre/midwest-emo/">Midwest Emo</a>. This style of music was characterized by whinier vocals, twinkly guitar parts, and a generally more melodramatic image. The genre takes its name from the cities a lot of bands credited with propagating the genre came from, most within the midwest. The genre is not limited to bands just from the midwest, but rather its name alludes to the locational origin. Important bands within this subgenre include <a title="[Artist2758]" href="/artist/mineral" class="artist"> Mineral</a>, <a title="[Artist10007]" href="/artist/capn-jazz" class="artist"> Cap'n Jazz</a>, <a title="[Artist2670]" href="/artist/american-football" class="artist"> American Football</a>, <a title="[Artist31657]" href="/artist/penfold" class="artist"> Penfold</a>, <a title="[Artist51]" href="/artist/sunny_day_real_estate" class="artist"> Sunny Day Real Estate</a>, and <a title="[Artist9825]" href="/artist/texas_is_the_reason" class="artist"> Texas Is the Reason</a>.\\r<br>\\r<br>            As with other nebulous genres, "emo" became distorted from an orthodox point-of-view, and was massively mislabeled in the early-2000s. This distortion was primarily caused by certain late 90s emo bands taking noticeable pop influence and achieving mainstream success because of it. What was labeled as "emo" then was sonically and visually different from what was labeled "emo" at the origin of the genre. Many other commercial bands were labeled as "emo", the term no longer having a hardcore connotation at all. This mislabeling eventually amalgamated in to the contemporary perception of the term, with any vaguely-whiny or "sad" music being called emo. Many alternative terms have arisen to allow fans of the early genre to refer to it without the current connotation - "skramz" [screamo] and "emotive/emotional hardcore" being the most popular.</span>\`,

The overdriven guitars provide a deeply-moving sense of urgency, which is possibly what causes fans of this band to adore this track in particular.

There is melancholy, rage, pained optimism and an invigorating naivete to be found on all the songs here. It is the auditory transcription of young human beings growing together, learning together, playing together and fighting together. Adolescent heart break and the inability to describe it. Growing in to and lifting out of a life of imitation and copy-cat moves. The distortion of the tape player you found at your local Genesis 12 NIV thrift store. Overworking yourself and drowning in schoolwork that you’re too lazy to complete even though you went through that rehabilitation thing where they taught you how to manage time properly or something. Patchwork, mod podge, quilt-laid groundworks lining the windows outside your view from the back of the plane. \\r<br>\\r<br>Carved out pumpkin carcasses and holy lanterns strewn across the street during the only time of year you feel at home with your little town. The new food market on the corner freaking you out because it lays on top of the land where you planted little tomato seeds with your mom as a toddler. Wishing you’ll one day get attention for all the cool drawings you put in your school notebook. Dog-greased car seat windowsills and matte images of autumnal colors flashing at high speeds. A reminder that as far as you’re concerned right now the suburbs were the only real place that ever existed anyways. This album is the culmination of necessary childhood catharsis. There is no wistfulness, there are no self-imposed public concerns  – these are the sounds of the memories you reflect back on in a contemplative fog. Listen to this and treasure every second of it. Fire is motion, work is repetition. This is their document.</span>',

Clearly borne out of emotional turmoil, both internal and observational, the music on this release ricochets through jaw-dropping passages of intense passion and fury. Political dissatisfaction and protest are woven in to each track here, as pointed at with the album cover – all songs expertly delivering on such ferocity. Despite its under-ten-minute runtime, not a single track here feels remotely underdeveloped or ‘too short’. It is apparent that these songs were written with visible attention and expertise. All three instrumental forces present on the release work in satisfying harmony; complex-yet-catchy guitar riffage twirls above furiously elegant drumming, all of which is supported by grounding and foundational bass playing. The vocal delivery is notably impressive as well, constructing an impressive sonic wall. \\r<br>\\r<br>Scattered across the four songs here are sporadic moments of intimate sparkle, where a faint twinkle glimmers in-between moments of chaos. The dynamics portrayed by such movement allow the heavy-hitting breakdowns to burst even more aggressively, as evident with the melodic turmoil at the end of “Human Repellant.” The pure unwavering rage pulls greatly at the heartstrings, really solidifying this outfit as something beyond just thrashing and chaotic screamo. “Easy to Blame”, with its charming melodicism, also epitomizes this group’s knack for cathartic impact. Emotiveness is at the heart of every track here, and such passion is perhaps the band’s strongest tool – bittersweet chord progressions and impressive songwriting being guided by such sadness. “Pulling the Knife Out of My Back” is a masterclass is short, to-the-point yet exceedingly harrowing hardcore. It left an immediate and lasting impression on me when I heard it in its entirety for the first time, and I suspect it will for all those who choose to throw it on too.

The opener, "Freighttrains and Windsongs", is definitely my favorite on the release. The song is incredibly gorgeous, sweeping guitar lines outfitting crooning vocals and reserved drums. It feels very slowcore-adjacent. The second song, "Gladhand", is a little more experimental. It feels improvised in away, bucolic textures colliding to form more of an atmosphere than a song. "Prainer the VIII", the final song, continues in the same vein as the first. Windswept guitars and hushed, melancholy lyrics. It's beautiful and gives satisfying closure to the release.

      html: \`<br><span class="rendered_text"><a href="/artist/floral-patterns" class="artist">Floral Patterns</a> are one of the greatest groups to emerge out of the new wave of midwest-emo-inspired skramz bands. They play a style of the genre that is exceedingly emotional and depressive, writing and performing from an intensely heartfelt perspective. This release -- <a href="/release/ep/floral-patterns/the-time-it-takes-to-get-from-place-to-place-and-how-people-change/" class="album">The Time It Takes to Get From Place to Place and How People Change</a> -- is their debut, and in my opinion serves as one of the best first efforts that any band in current memory has put out. It summates many of the trademarks that can be found in the recent years of the genre's history in a truly loveable way; raw, endearing, and more than anything else, cathartic. All four tracks here are filled to the brim with an intense passion and a charming DIY-oriented sound, allowing the band to capture an engaging style of powerful emotion and artistry. The opening song, "Decay (Alone)" is a heartfelt ode to the disintegration of relationships and the sadness that comes with such tragedy. Its sprinkled with quotes from the films <a href="/film/naked/" class="film">Naked</a> and <a href="/film/my_dinner_with_andre/" class="film">My Dinner with Andre</a>, both excerpts dealing with a sense of existential dread and sadness. The spoken accompaniments allow the song's message to really be driven home in a thought-provoking way that wouldn't have been achievable otherwise.\\r<br>\\r<br>My favorite track on the release is the melodic dirge "Before I Self Destruct", which is by far the most cinematic song here. The catchy and overdriven primary guitar part really allows the song to shine and revel in its cathartic emotional exertion. The vocal delivery throughout all songs here is great as well, and is extremely genuine in its execution. I feel like all members of the band get to shine the most on the closer, "We Can't Stop Here, This is Marlboro Country", which is another standout on the EP. The intro is the fastest and most aggressive section on the release, showing that the band doesn't lose their balance when the tempo speeds up. The song eventually moves forward in to a swirl of reverbed guitars bringing a relatively upbeat sense of closure to everything. The EP closes with an endearing sample of the band jamming out in their rehearsal space. It's a funny little bit that just makes this release feel all the more personal and heartfelt. If you're interested in the modern screamo underground and the wonderful music that's being produced in it, Floral Patterns could not be a better starting place to dive in. Captivating, sincere, and cathartic, "The Time It Takes..." is a wonderful debut that assuredly marks the start of a bright and successful future for Floral Patterns.</span>\`,

The two songs here are really addicting to listen to, and I often catch myself playing them multiple times each every time I throw this release on. The guitarwork is impressive and intricate in composition, greatly complimented by the reserved drum arrangements. The bass playing here is really great too, offering satisfying melodic counterpoint.

      html: \`<br><span class="rendered_text"><a href="/artist/the-guns-of-august" class="artist">The Guns of August</a> were an emo band from Houston, Texas, playing for a short period of time in the late 90's. Dwayne Cathey, the vocalist and guitarist of the group, also played in <a href="/artist/cedar-of-lebanon" class="artist">Cedar of Lebanon</a> and <a href="/artist/the_tie_that_binds" class="artist">The Tie That Binds</a> (who were previously known as <a href="/artist/badger-1" class="artist">Badger</a>). The group released two 7"s, amounting to a total of four songs. There is little information known or publicized about this group, which is truly a shame, as I believe the two songs here to be some of the best midwest emo ever put to vinyl. They're quite sprawling, perfectly complimenting the liminality of the album cover -- a blurry photograph of a roadway at night. Images as such cement the feeling of being "in-between" that I get from both tracks here. \\r<br>\\r<br>Anthems for travel and movement, the driving instrumentation found on these songs really propel forward in an idiosyncratic way. The songwriting on this 7" is very impressive as well, never once finding itself dull or derivative. There's just enough deviation and personality in the arrangements for lovable details to sneak themselves in, oftentimes requiring several listens to fully pick up on. The vocal delivery here is wonderful too -- a raspy and melodic yell is present as opposed to the melodic wails that are found on other emo recordings of the time. Every instrumental performance is just as passionate as the vocals, especially the metrical and expansive drumming, which is complimented by a very unique and room-y snare sound. To put it shortly, when I think of what the greatest midwest emo sounds like, The Guns of August always come to mind. Emotional and reflective yet still fiery and passionate. This release is a lost classic, in my opinion -- I cross my fingers that time is kind to this band, and that they get the attention and praise they deserve.</span>\`,

Artificial bone-white planks of chipped wood stacked in the suggested shape of a house. Tornado sirens lining periphery, covered in weather-marks and invisible waste-signs. Sleeping orchids and worn-out piano benches. Keys stuck to the floor of the ivory-door, locked up in a broken gold. Beds of flowers and chalk nails dispersed around a neighborhood. A soft blanket of pale shelter embraced by the roof below you. A nocturnal ambivalence encased by future-weary unease.\\r<br>\\r<br>The music feels apocalyptic, in a way.

This release has been an accompaniment to me over these past months and has helped push me through the immeasurable difficulty of modern life. I connect deeply with the same emotional chaos that is presented here. Simultaneously life-affirming and absolutely devastating, one of if not the best screamo release ever recorded.\\r<br>\\r<br>Attached below is a write-up from the band themselves.

To say that we did those same things would be the very truth of what we accomplished in the three years since Jon and I said we wanted to be in a band that sounded like Neil Perry. In the time we did this we found our medication for whatever troubles the adolescent young adult mind can come up with, break ups, broken hearts, mind games,self doubt, looking to the future and being uncertain where you'll be. These things pushed us to find a way to cope with our lives in a hard time. We found solace in our friendships. To think of everything we've been through and how honest we were lyrically and musically with this band can only be found by the people who chose to look there for it. We did this for everyone who ever cared about us, but couldn't do it without each other. To be over and done with now makes me feel good, I know I'll always have this time to look back on.

      html: \`<br><span class="rendered_text">In my mind, this record evokes feelings of intoxicating misery. There is a sarcastic disenchantment guiding each song here -- the same feeling one would get from living in denial of some emotional catastrophe, recovering from the remains of a broken and misconstrued line of communication. It's the sound of heartbreak and supreme self-pity turning in to a lifetime of hating the world around you and anyone who you come in to contact with. The transition from caring deeply about those who are supporting you in your times of need to being angry at them for even suggesting assistance. The album plays back to the listener like a summary of trauma, a retelling of the past month's pain, however some place through it becomes a diatribe against yourself and a desperate attempt to try and not cry. It's the dichotomic struggle of grappling with juvenile emotions, yet being too helpless to even try to feel another way. \\r<br>\\r<br>You can audibly hear the catharsis in the music here, as each scream yelps and bursts its way through the roaring tide of distortion and rage. A desolate sadness is to be felt in the more slowcore influenced songs, such as "Kind of a Long Way Down," where through reserved prose a suicide is recounted from the perspective of a confused onlooker. Each song on the record tells some ingenious tale of nuanced despair, reflecting the inner turmoil of those writing it in some poetic façade. The humorous tragedy of confusing a drowning swimmer with a happy waving smile, the sardonic description of an 'urban barbie' hiding undertones of furious jealousy. Although not included on original pressings of the record, "To a Husband at War" serves as a perfect thesis for the atmosphere this band is trying to evoke. In it contains some of the most utterly depressing lyrics I'd argue were ever put to tape. It's a tale of distance and touch-starvation, an inability to comfort your lover as they meet an uncertain death.\\r<br>\\r<br> A wife to a husband at war hasn't seen them for months as their lover spends time in a brutal war, each day fearing for his existence. Unable to communicate, unable to connect, and unable to move forward. Each day is spent in reflection of how things used to be, drowning in a dreadful anxiety. Upon the news of his death, the wife mistakenly recounts running to her room and crying, only correcting herself later as the room belonged to the both of them. He's been gone so long that her mind instinctually considered it no longer his abode. As soon as such realization occurs, the song erupts in to a blistering anguish -- tidal waves of raw emotion and rage swallow you whole as a call for retreat sounds in the distance. In these lyrics, a subdued message can be found. It perfectly summates the body's unstoppable urge to move on in direct opposition to the mind's inability to let go. Not only are you in a conflict with your missing lover, you exist in a state of conflict with your mental and physical needs. It's miserable, and it's terrifying to analyze for long periods of time. Unfortunately for most, there is nothing that anybody can do about this liminal feeling of existential unease. The only hope for a future is to find higher meaning in your pain, and turn it in to such beautiful art as this.</span>\`,

In one of their many defining moments, the band grasps for untouched heights on "Words Come Back" -- a song just as quintessential as your  Dü's "Celebration Summer" or One Last Wish's "My Better Half".\`,

      html: \`<br><span class="rendered_text">Setting themselves apart from their peers, <a title="[Artist1330553]" href="/artist/infant-island" class="artist"> Infant Island</a>'s debut album plays out with a fiery passion and engulfing atmosphere. Incorporating elements of shoegaze and post-rock, the group fuses the aforementioned genres with the hallmarks of modern screamo, tying everything together through a crisp, bright, and clear production job. The band is remarkably good at constructing massive walls of sound, pummeling the listener with titanic force and intensity. \\r<br>\\r<br>Whenever I throw this album on, I can't help but think of aquatic imagery -- clear pools of seafoam green, sprawling ocean-side fields, and windswept cloudscapes. The excellent usage of effects and pedals here only helps such imagery to be evoked. A satisfying combination of chorus and reverb give the guitar-playing an addicting edge, which is also mirrored in the fuzzed and distorted bass tone that propels these tracks forward. Heavy usage of cymbals and rides allow these atmospheres to be built on a sturdy basis, really filling out the mix. The vocals soar and pierce on top of it all with great consideration to what the band is trying to play. Coming all together, as mentioned before, it forms an enormous wall of sound that completely pummels the listener in the best way possible. \\r<br>\\r<br>There are many nuanced details on this record as well, contributing to the impressive sound the band has -- the piano outro to "Broken Pieces" for example, or the additional violin during the outro of "Diminish". If I had to pick a favorite track here, I'd say that "Fall" would take the cake. A surprisingly catchy tune, the song implements a hard-hitting groove all throughout that really sells it to me. The short length of this album is the cherry on top of it all, no song ever outstaying their welcome. One of my favorite debuts in the genre as of recent, Infant Island's self-titled is satisfying, engaging, and more than anything else entertaining to listen to. It's easy to get lost in the aquatic atmospheres displayed here and wade around in the emotional turmoil.</span>\`,

      html: \`<br><span class="rendered_text">On <a href="/artist/infant-island" class="artist">Infant Island</a>'s second album "Beneath", the sound of a band fully coming in to their own can be heard. The record is an exercise in oceanic punishment, brimming with brutality and rage, all the while grooving out a unique path in the world of modern screamo. The band is definitely at their best here, playing an idiosyncratic style of music that is simultaneously thrilling and inventive. The album opens with the black metal-tinged "Here We Are", a perfect introduction to the destruction about to ensue. It serves as both a mission statement and a warning, preparing the listener for the ride they're about to be taken through at break-neck speeds. \\r<br>\\r<br>The second track, "Signed in Blood", is composed of crushing aquatic noise. It's reminiscent of the auditory destruction found in <a href="/artist/the-rita" class="artist">The Rita</a>'s <a href="/release/album/the-rita/sea-wolf-leviathan/" class="album">Sea Wolf Leviathan</a>; an overwhelmingly titanic tidal wave of pure behemoth violence -- relentlessly aggressive, yet still somehow jaw-droppingly beautiful. It serves as a perfect segue in to the ominous and atmospheric "Content", which ends up collapsing in to one of the most brutal breakdowns the band has ever delivered. The song leaves the listener on a wistful note, a piano and some string instruments bringing it to a tasteful close. Immediately afterwards, "The Garden" unfurls like a withering flower and picks up with commendable fury. \\r<br>\\r<br>The tracks afterwards continue with similar patterns, remaining relentlessly brutal and atmospheric. Even the interludes on the album -- "Colossal Air", for example -- are highlights. The entire record is incredibly cinematic, building on the basis they constructed with their debut album. Sweeping panoramas of windblown plateaus in collision with titanic forces of aquatic miasma are evoked in my mind, greatly contributing to just how god damn massive this album feels. The entire record builds to the earth-shattering "Stare Spells", an exemplary exercise in how post-rock tinged screamo <i>should</i> be done. There are so many little moments and details on this album to be discovered and appreciated; it's very easy to tell that the band really honed in on perfecting this record.

Although their shortest official release in length, the mini LP doesn't suffer from an unsatisfying run-time. It fully succeeds in every aspect that I appreciate this band for, checking off all the idiosyncratic boxes that make this group stand out to me. The track-listing kicks off with the feral "Burrow", serving as the most aggressive and upfront song here. It overwhelms the listener in an engaging way, and is filled with brutal walls of distortion clashing in a hurried fury. Afterwards comes "Unspoken", a song that continues in the same vein as its prior yet progresses forward with a more cinematic styling. The build-up half-way through is legitimately terrifying, creating the necessary ambiance for its thrashing breakdown to work properly. Its chorus section is nothing but harrowing, and is definitely a standout on this release. \\r<br>\\r<br>One of the most unique things about this group would be their penchant for fusing noise in to their sound, evident in songs like "Phantom Whines". The track is a <a href="/release/album/yellow-swans/going-places/" class="album">Going Places</a>-era <a href="/artist/yellow-swans" class="artist">Yellow Swans</a>-esque industrial ambient piece that serves as a complimentary reprieve between the prior two songs and the closer. Its followed up by the goliath "Awoken", my personal favorite song here. The band is at their most heart-wrenching, wonderfully synchronizing all the traits of their style in to one monolithic sum. The blast at three minutes in serves as the emotional climax of this album, a complete and total implosion that veers straight in to atmospheric black metal territory. After the song breathes for a bit, it picks back up and continues constructing more massive apocalyptic soundscapes. The vocals totally blow out in to a harsh noise wall at the seven minute thirty seconds mark, allowing the band to bring the heaving violence to a worthy conclusion. The track collapses in to a funeral dirge-like exhaustion, melting away in to a pool of aquatic ambiance by its end. It's up there with some of the best longform songs in the genre, and is definitely a highlight point in the group's discography. Sepulcher is my personal favorite release Infant Island has to offer, and is without a doubt a triumph for the recent screamo revival.</span>\`,

Their discography is very short only consisting of a handful of songs. In total, their entire work totals to the length of roughly thirty minutes. Despite its brevity I thoroughly persist that they have one of the best discographies in UK emotional hardcore. Their songwriting ranges from just greatly consistent to undeniably jaw-dropping, expertly weaving crescendos colliding with one another in to an end product that is remarkably unique.

Dark and affronting phrases are shouted with such conviction, sounding like an improvised reading of poetry. This band has one of my favorite vocal delivery styles, and it gets to shine on this EP in particular.

There is very little information about this group on the internet -- as usual with this genre, unfortunately. <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/1581949-Lonely-Broken-Radio"> Discogs</a> mentions that the band had Mike Nogroski from <a href="/artist/the-trigger-quintet" class="artist">The Trigger Quintet</a>, <a href="/artist/the_desert_jet_set" class="artist">The Desert Jet Set</a>, and <a href="/artist/bucketfull" class="artist">Bucketfull</a> in it, although I'm not entirely sure regarding the accuracy of that account as there isn't any text on the record itself regarding Mike's involvement (that I've seen). It is stated on the back cover however that this EP was recorded by Marco Acosta at Buffalo Laboratories between May 18th and 19th, 1996; yet once more it doesn't specify if Acosta was in the group or if he had produced the record. Regardless of its relative obscurity and mystery, the music contained on this seven-inch is thoroughly enjoyable mid-90's emo. \\r<br>\\r<br>The two songs here are cryptic and atmospheric in nature, twirling and repetitive guitar lines dancing around minimalist bass and drum arrangements. The sparsity of the instrumentation and low-fidelity recording give this seven-inch a remarkably intimate feeling, almost as if you're right up next to the group as their playing these wistful dirges. The first song, "Bigger Miracles", is a sprawling and pastoral track. The opening bass riff never fails to set me in a contemplative mood. Dynamics are key here, as tension unravels and builds all across the song. The vocal delivery is very endearing too, reciting floating and wispy poems on top of the reflective music. Everything in the track comes to a satisfying close as the instruments fade out gently. \\r<br>\\r<br>"Situated", the second song, is my personal favorite here. Its a bit of a rainier affair, à la the dark and brooding slowcore of <a href="/artist/the-sky-by-sorella" class="artist">The Sky by Sorella</a>. The arpeggiation in the bass during the climax of the song especially reminds me of that group. Images of dejected drives through city-outskirts and passing by suburban decay flood my mind as I listen, the swung rhythms and strumming guitar evoking a deep melancholy. I adore the vocal delivery in this track even more-so than the first, with the singing taking a much more whisper-oriented approach. It's easily one of my favorite songs from this period of emo, as is this seven-inch as a whole for the genre. From the fantastic name of the group to the unique visual presentation, as well as the mysterious obscurity, everything about this release is lovable and hypnotizing.

Fusing a Louisville hardcore sound, the intense technicality of math rock, and the depressive tendencies of second wave emocore, their music was a swirling and frightening amalgam of thrashing freak-outs and melodic anxiety. Minimal and threadbare in instrumentation, yet gargantuan in dynamics and presence. <a href="/release/album/a-minor-forest/flemish-altruism-constituent-parts-1993-1996/" class="album"> Flemish Altruism</a> is considering their masterwork, a sprawling double LP produced by both <a title="[Artist252729]" href="/artist/steve-albini" class="artist"> Steve Albini</a> and <a title="[Artist954111]" href="/artist/bob_weston_f1" class="artist"> Bob Weston</a> of <a title="[Artist5187]" href="/artist/shellac" class="artist"> Shellac</a>. The even-numbered tracks on the album were recorded by Albini, while the odd were recorded by Weston. The separation and recording differences between the two are of an important note - the even tracks are more noisy and in-line with the noise rock musings of <a title="[Artist10540]" href="/artist/rodan" class="artist"> Rodan</a> or <a title="[Artist2730]" href="/artist/don-caballero" class="artist"> Don Caballero</a>, while the odds are more atmospheric and depressive, evening the pace out with slowcore-inspired dirges. Although it is not explicitly stated, many listeners have pointed out that the track-listing may be the combination of two previously separate records. One (the odds) would be slower, and one (the evens) would be faster, thus the denotation "<i>Constituent Parts</i>" in the title. Within each song still remains an obvious link to one another however, and the perceived separates still works fantastically as a united whole. In line with the majority of math rock, some of these tracks have long and absurd titles. Unlike some infuriatingly <a href="/release/ep/minus-the-bear/this-is-what-i-know-about-being-gigantic/" class="album"> tacky</a> examples within the genre, these names actually play to the advantage of the song. They contribute quite well to the unorthodox and unsettling atmosphere this record conjures. \\r<br>\\r<br>The first song "But the Pants Stay On..." is a harmonics-driven number. Complimented by barely-audible yet despairing vocals, the melancholic piece serves as a good summative of the record's dynamics. There are some math-y explosions interspersed amongst the slower segments, as per the quiet-loud-quiet dynamic pattern. The second track on the record, the ridiculously titled "Bill's Mom Likes to Fuck", is a much longer and more intense number. It's incredibly sprawling, each movement composing the entire song being quite ephemeral. The first five minutes or so are composed of a swaying call-and-response, distorted descending lines angrily retorting to minimal clean passages. Afterwards, things pick up quite considerably, the song shifting in to a consistent mid-tempo middle section. Still instrumental, the dissonant guitar bounces atop the heavy bass with great contrast. Near the six minute mark, vocals come in, and things begin to crescendo. The song slowly builds and builds, each repetitive iteration gradually become louder and more driven than the last. The vocals rise, eventually breaking in to a cathartic yell as things distort even further. They quickly turn to incendiary screams as chaos descends upon the track. The math-y anxiety of the first movement has now been distorted in to a thrashing and cathartic breakdown that sounds straight off of <a href="/release/comp/indian-summer/science-1994/" class="album"> Science 1994</a>. Hissing and impassioned screams erupt in violent fervor on top of some of the most brutal playing these genres have to offer. The song, no longer able to push the intensity any further, slowly disintegrates, each instrument falling apart and collapsing in exhaustion. Immediately, as the song ends, we are thrust in to "Ed is 50". This pattern continues throughout the record - brutality immediately confronted by startling silence. The most drastic example of this is perhaps the beginning of the hilariously-titled "Jacking Off George Lucas". In an incredible contrast to the title, the song is genuinely one of the most depressive and miserable songs I've ever heard. It is without a doubt in my eyes the standout track on the record, and the one I've returned to the most. Very much in the vein of <a title="[Artist819]" href="/artist/slint" class="artist"> Slint</a>'s Washer, it is a post-rock/slowcore dirge that trods upon the listener with arresting sadness. The vocals are again barely audible, yet the emotion in the half-spoken delivery is what allows them to have such an undeniable effect. Quiet, then loud, and then quiet again, the song contains some of the most impressive dynamics to be found in their whole discography. Half-way through the song, things quickly crescendo, and out of nowhere it becomes even more depressing and dismal. A heart-rending and melodic cello erupts in conjunction with the guitar line, and the vocals keen in distress and patient rage. Stunningly beautiful yet miserably bleak. Afterwards, yet again, contrast being key, the album throws the listener in to "Speed For Gavin". For the sake of brevity, I am not going to describe in thorough detail the entire track listing. I don't want this write-up to be overly long, and I don't want to perhaps spoil any surprises one may have while listening to this record. \\r<br>\\r<br><a href="/release/album/a-minor-forest/flemish-altruism-constituent-parts-1993-1996/" class="album"> Flemish Altruism</a> is without a doubt one of the most incredible records that this vein of emotional hardcore has to offer.
